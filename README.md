This respository contains the model code and the initial Delft3D files of the domain used in the above publication. The model consists of several modules that describe the interactions between MATLAB and Delft3D, the post-processing of the output data from the Delft3D model and the species computations. More detailed information can be found in the attached pdf. Please reference the paper when using (parts of) the model.
The model is tested in MATLAB 2017a and Delft3D FLOW 4.03.01.
